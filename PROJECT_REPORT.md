# Day 1: Empathise & Define

# Step 1: Understanding the Need

**Which problem am I trying to solve?**

People face delays and confusion during emergencies due to outdated dispatch systems that lack real-time tracking and intelligent coordination.

**Who is affected by this problem?**

Citizens experiencing emergencies, emergency service providers (ambulance, fire, police), and dispatch coordinators who struggle with manual processes.

**How did I find out about this?**

- ☑ Online Research
- ☑ AI Tools
- ☑ Observation
- ☑ Interviews

# Step 2: What is the problem?

- Emergency response systems rely on voice-only reporting with no visual or location data
- Citizens have no visibility into response status after calling for help
- Manual dispatch decisions lead to suboptimal resource allocation
- Legacy infrastructure cannot leverage modern GPS and AI technologies
- Response times are delayed due to lack of real-time coordination

**How did I find out about this?**

- ☑ Online Research
- ☑ AI Tools
- ☑ Observation

# Why is this problem important to solve?

I am ideating a solution for users who face life-threatening delays during emergencies due to inefficient dispatch systems. Every minute of delay can significantly impact survival rates, especially in medical emergencies where the "golden hour" concept applies.

# Take-home task

- Many users said it's hard to know if help is actually coming after calling emergency services
- Some suggested adding real-time tracking so they can see responders approaching
- A few recommended having an AI assistant to guide them through first-aid while waiting

# AI Tools used for Step 1 and 2:

1. **ChatGPT**: Used for understanding emergency response workflows and user pain points
2. **Perplexity AI**: Used for researching existing emergency systems and their limitations

---

# Day 2: Ideate

# Step 3: List at least 5 different solutions (wild or realistic):

1. **RapidAid AI Emergency Platform** – A web app with real-time tracking map showing emergency locations and responding units with animated markers
2. **Voice-to-Text Emergency Reporter** – AI converts panicked voice calls into structured emergency reports automatically
3. **Drone-First Response System** – Drones deliver first-aid kits while ambulances are en route
4. **Community Emergency Network** – Nearby trained volunteers get notified to provide immediate assistance
5. **Predictive Emergency System** – AI predicts high-risk areas and pre-positions resources

# Step 4: My favourite solution:

My favourite solution is **RapidAid AI**, a web-based emergency response platform that features real-time tracking maps with animated markers, AI-powered severity assessment, and comprehensive dashboards for citizens and administrators.

# Step 5: Why am I choosing this solution?

I am choosing this solution because:
- Users need transparency and real-time visibility during emergencies
- Real-time tracking reduces anxiety and prevents redundant calls
- AI analysis ensures consistent and accurate emergency prioritization
- The solution is feasible to implement with current web technologies
- It addresses the core problems of delayed response and lack of coordination

# Step 9: Reflections

# What did I enjoy the most during this project-based learning activity?

I enjoyed building the real-time emergency tracking map with animated markers. Creating the pulsing emergency indicators and moving responder units brought the application to life. Designing the dark-themed UI with emergency colors (red, amber, green) and seeing the complete system work together was incredibly satisfying.

# What was my biggest challenge during this project-based learning activity?

My biggest challenge was implementing the CSS-based animated map simulation without using actual mapping APIs. Creating realistic movement animations for responder units and ensuring smooth performance across all devices required careful planning. Coordinating the state management between multiple components (map, dashboard, forms) also required thoughtful architecture decisions.
